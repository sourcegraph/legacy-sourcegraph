# Sourcegraph uses CODENOTIFY to make individuals or groups aware of changes that are happening in code they care about,
# without explicitly requiring those engineers to "own" the code.
# This file is meant to protect critical code from accidental changes, and should be used sparsingly to prevent slowdowns
# from code reviews.
