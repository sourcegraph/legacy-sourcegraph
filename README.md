## Try it now

Sourcegraph has three editions:

- [Sourcegraph.com](https://sourcegraph.com) lets you search over the open source ecosystem. [Search strings](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+failed+to+ensure+HEAD+exists&patternType=literal), [search patterns](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+lang:python+range%28len%28:%5B1%5D%29%29&patternType=structural), [search symbols](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+type:symbol+lang:typescript+%28OA%7Coa%7COa%29uth+%5BHh%5Dandler+-file:%28%5E%7C/%29node_modules/+&patternType=regexp&case=yes) and [find references](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/spf13/cobra@a684a6d7f5e37385d954dd3b5a14fc6912c6ab9d/-/blob/command.go?L221:19&subtree=true#tab=references) across your entire codebase and the open source world.

> Source code for all three editions is contained in this repository. See the [License section](#license) for more details.

## Sourcegraph Self-hosted

### Sourcegraph Enterprise (free up to 10 users)

The fastest way to run Sourcegraph self-hosted is with the Docker container. See the [quickstart installation guide](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/#getting-started). There are also several additional ways of running a [production instance](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/install).

### Sourcegraph OSS

1. Go through [Quickstart](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev/setup/quickstart) to install `sg` and dependencies
1. Start the development environment in OSS mode:

   ```sh
   sg start oss
   ```

Sourcegraph should now be running at https://sourcegraph.test:3443.

For detailed instructions and troubleshooting, see the [local development documentation](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev).

## License

This repository contains both OSS-licensed and non-OSS-licensed files. We maintain one repository rather than two separate repositories mainly for development convenience.

All files in the `enterprise` and `client/web/src/enterprise` fall under [LICENSE.enterprise](LICENSE.enterprise).

The remaining files fall under the [Apache 2 license](LICENSE.apache). Sourcegraph OSS is built only from the Apache-licensed files in this repository.
