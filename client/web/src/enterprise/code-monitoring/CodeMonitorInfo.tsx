        We currently recommend code monitors on repositories that donâ€™t have a high commit traffic and for non-critical
        use cases.
        <br />
        We are actively working on increasing the performance and fidelity of code monitors to support more sensitive
        workloads, like a large number of repositories or auditing published code for secrets and other security use
        cases.
