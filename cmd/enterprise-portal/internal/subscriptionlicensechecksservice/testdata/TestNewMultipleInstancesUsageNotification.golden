Subscription "subscription-display-name"'s license <https://sourcegraph.com/site-admin/dotcom/product/subscriptions/subscription-id#license-id|license-id> failed a license check, as it seems to be used by multiple Sourcegraph instance IDs:

- `instance-id-1`
- `instance-id-2`

This could mean that the license key is attempting to be used on multiple Sourcegraph instances.

To fix it, <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xzlkJd3HXGLzB67N7o-9T1s1YXhc1LeGDdJyKDyqfbI/edit#heading=h.mr6npkexi05j|follow the guide to update the siteID and license key for all customer instances>.
