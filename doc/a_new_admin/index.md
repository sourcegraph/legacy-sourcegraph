# Administration

Site administrators, or admins, are responsible for deploying, managing, and configuring Sourcegraph for regular users, what we would call Administration. 

In addition, Admins have [special privileges](privileges.md) on a Sourcegraph instance that enable a wide variety of functionality, including customization, access management, and repository management, as well as management for other activities such as monitoring, alerting, upgrading, and migration.

We've broken our Administration docs into sections (the list below).
 
## [Deployment](deployment/index.md)

The deployment section of our docs covers everything you need regardless of the type or size of the deployment you need to do. 

We recommend starting with the [Deployment Overview](deployment/index.md). It highlights the different deployment types available. It also provides high-level instruction for many concepts that will be helpful throughout your interaction with Sourcegraph as an admin.
