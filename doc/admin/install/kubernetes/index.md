# Sourcegraph with Kubernetes

<p class="lead">
Deploying Sourcegraph on Kubernetes is for organizations that need highly scalable and
available code search and code intelligence.

## About

### Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. Applications are deployed via set a of YAML files to configure the various components (storage, networking, containers). Learn more about Kubernetes [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/).

Installing Sourcgraph on Kubernetes has the following requirements:

- [Sourcegraph Enterprise license](configure.md#add-license-key). _You can run through these instructions without one, but you must obtain a license for instances of more than 10 users._
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) v1.15
  - Verify that you have enough capacity by following our [resource allocation guidelines](scale.md)
  - Sourcegraph requires an SSD backed [storage class](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/) for [persistent storage](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/). See
  - [Cluster role administrator access](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/)
- [PostgreSQL Database](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) v1.15 or later (run `kubectl version` for version info)
  - [Configure cluster access](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/access-cluster/) for `kubectl`

In addition to the requirements above, Sourcegrpah utilizes a number of other Kubernetes concepts. Please review the links below if you're unfamiliar with any of the following:

- [Kubernetes Objects](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/)
  - [Namespaces](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/)
- [Role Based Access Control](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/)
- [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/)
- [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/)

## Installation

The Kubernetes manifests for a Sourcegraph on Kubernetes installation are in the repository
 [deploy-sourcegraph](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph).

### Configuration

Before proceeding with the install steps, we recommend reading [configuration guide](configure.md) ensuring you have the following items prepared for installation.

 - [Customizations](./overlays.md)
 - [Storage class](./configure.md#configure-a-storage-class)
 - [Network Acess](./configure.md#security-configure-network-access)
 - [PostgreSQL Database](./configure.md#sourcegraph-databases)
 - [Scaling services](./scale.md#tuning-replica-counts-for-horizontal-scalability)

## Steps

1. After meeting all the requirements, make sure you can [access your cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/access-cluster/) with `kubectl`.

```bash
# Google Cloud Platform (GCP) users are required to give their user the ability to create roles in Kubernetes.
# See the [GCP's documentation: https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/role-based-access-control#prerequisites_for_using_role-based_access_control
kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-binding \
    --clusterrole cluster-admin --user $(gcloud config get-value account)
```

2) `cd` to the forked local copy of [deploy-sourcegraph](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph) repository previously setup during [configuration](./configure.md#getting-started):

```bash
# ðŸš¨ The master branch tracks development.
# Use the branch of this repository corresponding to the version of Sourcegraph you wish to deploy, e.g. git checkout 3.30
cd deploy-sourcegraph
export SOURCEGRAPH_VERSION="v3.30.3"
git checkout $SOURCEGRAPH_VERSION -b release
```

3) Deploy the desired version of Sourcegraph to your cluster:

```
./kubectl-apply-all.sh
```

4) Monitor the status of the deployment:

```
kubectl get pods -o wide --watch
```

5) After deployment is completed, verify Sourcegraph is running by temporarily making the frontend port accessible:

```
kubectl port-forward svc/sourcegraph-frontend 3080:30080
```

6) Open http://localhost:3080 in your browser and you will see a setup page.


7) ðŸŽ‰ Congrats, you have Sourcegraph up and running!

8) If you previously setup an `ingress-controller`, you can also access your deployment via the `sourcegraph-frontend-ingress`.

Run the following command, and ensure an IP address has been assigned to your ingress resource. Then browse to the IP or configured URL.
```
kubectl get ingress sourcegraph-frontend

NAME                   CLASS    HOSTS             ADDRESS     PORTS     AGE
sourcegraph-frontend   <none>   sourcegraph.com   8.8.8.8     80, 443   1d
```


### Troubleshooting

See the [Troubleshooting docs](troubleshoot.md).

### Updating

- See the [Updating Sourcegraph docs](update.md) on how to upgrade.<br/>
- See the [Updating a Kubernetes Sourcegraph instance docs](../../updates/kubernetes.md) for details on changes in each version to determine if manual migration steps are necessary.


## Cloud installation guides

>**Security note:** If you intend to set this up as a production instance, we recommend you create the cluster in a VPC
>or other secure network that restricts unauthenticated access from the public Internet. You can later expose the
>necessary ports via an
>[Internet Gateway](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html) or equivalent
>mechanism. Take care to secure your cluster in a manner that meets your organization's security requirements.


Follow the instructions linked in the table below to provision a Kubernetes cluster for the
infrastructure provider of your choice, using the recommended node and list types in the
table.

> Note: Sourcegraph can run on any Kubernetes cluster, so if your infrastructure provider is not
> listed, see the "Other" row. Pull requests to add rows for more infrastructure providers are
> welcome!
