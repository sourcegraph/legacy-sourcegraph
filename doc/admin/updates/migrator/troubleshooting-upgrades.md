# Troubleshooting Upgrades

### Failing migrations

Migrations may fail due to transient or application errors. When this happens, the database will be marked by the migrator as _dirty_. A dirty database requires manual intervention to ensure the schema is in the expected state before continuing with migrations or application startup.

In order to retrieve the error message printed by the migrator on startup, you'll need to use the `kubectl logs <frontend pod> -c migrator` to specify the init container, not the main application container. Using a bare `kubectl logs` command will result in the following error:

```
Error from server (BadRequest): container "frontend" in pod "sourcegraph-frontend-69f4b68d75-w98lx" is waiting to start: PodInitializing
```

Once a failing migration error message can be found, follow the guide on [how to troubleshoot a dirty database](../../how-to/dirty_database.md).
