# Quickstart for Batch Changes

Get started and create your first [batch change](index.md) in 10 minutes or less.

## Introduction

In this guide, you'll create a Sourcegraph batch change that appends text to `README.md` files in all of your repositories.

For more information about Batch Changes, watch the [Batch Changes demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfKwKFzOs3E).

## Requirements

- A Sourcegraph instance with some repositories in it. See "[Quick install](../index.md#quick-install)" on how to set up a Sourcegraph instance.
- A local environment matching "[Requirements](./references/requirements.md)" to create batch changes with the Sourcegraph CLI.

## Install the Sourcegraph CLI

In order to create batch changes we need to [install the Sourcegraph CLI](../cli/index.md) (`src`).

1. Install the version of `src` that's compatible with your Sourcegraph instance:

    **macOS**:
    ```
    curl -L https://YOUR-SOURCEGRAPH-INSTANCE/.api/src-cli/src_darwin_amd64 -o /usr/local/bin/src
    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/src
    ```
    **Linux**:
    ```
    curl -L https://YOUR-SOURCEGRAPH-INSTANCE/.api/src-cli/src_linux_amd64 -o /usr/local/bin/src
    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/src
    ```
2. Authenticate `src` with your Sourcegraph instance by running **`src login`** and following the instructions:

    ```
    src login https://YOUR-SOURCEGRAPH-INSTANCE
    ```
    <img src="https://sourcegraphstatic.com/docs/images/batch_changes/src_login_success.png" class="screenshot">


Once `src login` reports that you're authenticated, we're ready for the next step.

## Write a batch spec

A **batch spec** is a YAML file that defines a batch change. It specifies which changes should be made in which repositories.

See the ["batch spec YAML reference"](references/batch_spec_yaml_reference.md) for details.

Save the following batch spec as `hello-world.batch.yaml`:

```yaml
name: hello-world
description: Add Hello World to READMEs

# Find all repositories that contain a README.md file.
on:
  - repositoriesMatchingQuery: file:README.md

# In each repository, run this command. Each repository's resulting diff is captured.
steps:
  - run: echo Hello World | tee -a $(find -name README.md)
    container: alpine:3

# Describe the changeset (e.g., GitHub pull request) you want for each repository.
changesetTemplate:
  title: Hello World
  body: My first batch change!
  branch: hello-world # Push the commit to this branch.
  commit:
    message: Append Hello World to all README.md files
```

The commits you create here will use the git config values for `user.name` and `user.email` from your local environment, or "batch-changes@sourcegraph.com" if no user is set. Alternatively, you can also [specify an `author`](./references/batch_spec_yaml_reference.md#changesettemplate-commit-author) in this spec.

## Create the batch change

Let's see the changes that will be made. Don't worry---no commits, branches, or changesets will be published yet (the repositories on your code host will be untouched).

1. In your terminal, run this command:

    <pre>src batch preview -f hello-world.batch.yaml</pre>
    <!-- TODO: Update pictures -->
1. Wait for it to run and compute the changes for each repository.

1. When it's done, click the displayed link to see the **preview page** of all the changes that will be made.
    <img src="https://sourcegraphstatic.com/docs/images/batch_changes/src_batch_preview_link.png" class="screenshot">
1. Make sure the changes look right.

1. If you want to modify which changes are made, edit the `hello-world.batch.yaml` file, rerun the `src batch preview` command and open the newly generated preview URL.

    >NOTE: If you want to run the batch change on fewer repositories, change the `repositoriesMatchingQuery` in `hello-world.batch.yaml` to something like `file:README.md repo:myproject` (to only match repositories whose name contains `myproject`).

## Publish the changes

So far, nothing has been created on the code hosts yet. For that to happen, we need to publish the changesets in our batch change.

Publishing causes commits, branches, and pull requests/merge requests to be created on your code host.

_You probably don't want to publish these toy "Hello World" changesets to actively developed repositories, because that might confuse people ("Why did you add this line to our READMEs?")._

### Configure code host credentials

Batch Changes needs permission to open changesets on your behalf. To grant permission, you will need to [add a personal access token](how-tos/configuring_credentials.md#adding-a-token) for each code host you'll be publishing changesets on.

This is a one-time operation that you don't need to do for each batch change. You can also ask the administrators of your Sourcegraph instance to [configure global credentials](how-tos/configuring_credentials.md#global-service-account-tokens) instead.

Once you have successfully added a token, Sourcegraph will have everything it needs to publish changesets to that code host!

### Publish to code hosts

Back from the **preview page**, for each changest, you can choose whether to leave it as-is unpublished, publish it as a normal pull request/merge request, or publish it as a draft (if the code host supports it). Let's try publishing some changesets normally:

<!-- TODO: Add pictures -->
1. Back from the **preview page**, select the changesets you would like to publish.
1. Open the actions dropdown, select "Publish", and then click again to update the preview.
1. You should see the updated actions reflect our intent to publish the changesets.
1. Click the **Apply** button to create the batch change and publish the changesets. You should see something like this:

## Congratulations!

You've created your first batch change! ðŸŽ‰

Feel free to customize your batch spec and experiment with making other types of changes.

To update your batch change, edit `hello-world.batch.yaml` and run `src batch preview` again. As before, you'll see a preview before any changes are applied, but this time, you'll be updating your existing changesets.
