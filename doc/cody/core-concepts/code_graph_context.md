# Code graph context

Code graph context is Cody's ability to respond to queries using contextual information of a codebase. We recommend configuring code graph context for the best Cody experience.

## Relevant code files

Cody reads relevant code files to increase the accuracy and quality of the response and make it match your own codebase's conventions. There are 2 ways Cody can find relevant code files: embeddings (preferred) and local keyword-based search.
