# Cody FAQ

<p class="subtitle">Find answers to the most common questions about Cody.</p>

## General

### Does Cody train on my code?

No, Cody does not train on your code. Our third-party Language Model (LLM) providers also do not train on your specific codebase. Cody operates by following a specific process to generate answers to your queries:

- **User query**: A user asks a question
- **Code retrieval**: Sourcegraph, our underlying code intelligence platform, performs a search and code intelligence operation to retrieve code snippets relevant to the user's question. During this process, strict permissions are enforced to ensure that only code that the user has read permission for is retrieved
- **Prompt to Language Model**: Sourcegraph sends a prompt, and the code snippets are retrieved to a Language Model (LLM). This prompt provides the context for the LLM to generate a meaningful response
- **Response to user**: The response generated by the LLM is then sent back to Cody and presented to the user

This process ensures that Cody can provide helpful answers to your questions while respecting data privacy and security by not training on or retaining your specific code.

### Does Cody work with self-hosted Sourcegraph?

Yes, Cody is compatible with self-hosted Sourcegraph instances. However, there are a few considerations:

- Cody operates by sending code snippets (up to 28 KB per request) to a third-party cloud service. By default, this service is Anthropic but can also be OpenAI
- For certain repositories, Cody may utilize embeddings, which involves sending repository data to another third-party service like OpenAI
- To use Cody effectively, your self-hosted Sourcegraph instance must have internet access for these interactions with external services

### Is there a public facing Cody API?

Currently, there is no public-facing Cody API available.

### Does Cody require Sourcegraph to function?

Yes, Cody relies on Sourcegraph for two essential functions:

- It is used to retrieve context relevant to user queries
- Sourcegraph acts as a proxy for the LLM provider to facilitate the interaction between Cody and the LLM

### What programming languages Cody supports?

Cody supports a wide range of programming languages, including:

JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, Python, Java, C/C++, C#, Ruby, Go, SQL, Swift, Objective-C, Perl, Rust, Kotlin, Scala, Groovy, R, MATLAB, Dart, Lua, Julia, Cobol and Shell scripting languages (like Bash, PowerShell).

## Embeddings

### What are embeddings for?

Embeddings are one of the many ways Sourcegraph uses to retrieve relevant code to feed the large language model as context. Embeddings / vector search are complementary to other strategies. While it matches really well semantically ("what is this code about, what does it do?"), it drops syntax and other important precise matching info. Sourcegraph's overall approach is to blend results from multiple sources to provide the best answer possible.

### When using embeddings, are permissions enforced? Does Cody get fed code that the users doesn't have access to?

Permissions are enforced when using embeddings. Today, Sourcegraph only uses embeddings search on a single repo, first checking that the users has access.

In the future, here are the steps that Sourcegraph will follow:

- determine which repo you have access to
- query embeddings for each of those repo
- pick the best results and send it back

### I scheduled a one-off embeddings job but it is not showing up in the list of jobs. What happened?

There can be several reasons why a job is not showing up in the list of jobs:

- The repository is already queued or being processed
- A job for the same repository and the same revision already completed successfully
- Another job for the same repository has been queued for processing within the [embeddings.MinimumInterval](./explanations/code_graph_context.md#adjust-the-minimum-time-interval-between-automatically-scheduled-embeddings) time window

### How do I stop a running embeddings job?

Jobs in state _QUEUED_ or _PROCESSING_ can be canceled by admins from the **Cody > Embeddings Jobs** page. To cancel a job, click on the _Cancel_ button of the job you want to cancel. The job will be marked for cancellation. Note that, depending on the state of the job, it might take a few seconds or minutes for the job to actually be canceled.

### What are the reasons files are skipped?

Files are skipped for the following reasons:

- The file is too large (1 MB)
- The file path matches an [exclusion pattern](./explanations/code_graph_context.md#excluding-files-from-embeddings)
- We have already generated more than [`embeddings.maxCodeEmbeddingsPerRepo`](./explanations/code_graph_context.md#limitting-the-number-of-embeddings-that-can-be-generated) or [`embeddings.maxTextEmbeddingsPerRepo`](./explanations/code_graph_context.md#limitting-the-number-of-embeddings-that-can-be-generated) embeddings for the repo.

## Third party dependencies

### What is the default `sourcegraph` provider for completions and embeddings?

The default `"provider": "sourcegraph"` for completions and embeddings is the [Sourcegraph Cody Gateway](./explanations/cody_gateway.md). Cody Gateway provides Sourcegraph enterprise instances access to completions and embeddings using third-party services like Anthropic and OpenAI.

### What third-party cloud services does Cody depend on today?

- Cody has one third-party dependency, which is Anthropic's Claude API. In the config, this can be replaced with OpenAI API.
- Cody can optionally use OpenAI to generate embeddings, that are then used to improve the quality of its context snippets, but this is not required.

The above is also the case even when using [the default `sourcegraph` provider, Cody Gateway](./explanations/cody_gateway.md), which uses the same third-party providers.

### What's the retention policy for Anthropic/OpenAI?

See our [terms](https://about.sourcegraph.com/terms/cody-notice).

### Can I use my own API keys?

Yes! you can use your own API keys.

### Can I use with my Cloud IDE?

Yes, Cody supports the following cloud development environments:

#### vscode.dev and GitHub Codespaces

You can install from the VS Code extension marketplace. To do so:

- Open Codespaces
- Install Cody AI by Sourcegraph
- Copy the URL in the browser, for example, `vscode://sourcegraph.cody-ai...`
- Open the Command Pallet <kbd>âŒ˜ Cmd/Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>
- Choose `Developer: Open URL` and paste the URL, then press <kbd>return</kbd>/<kbd>Enter</kbd>

#### Editors supporting the Open VSX Registry

Any editor supporting the [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/sourcegraph/cody-ai), including:

- [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/boosting-developer-productivity-unleashing-the-power-of-sourcegraph-cody-in-gitpod)
- Coder and `code-server` (you can install from the [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/sourcegraph/cody-ai))
