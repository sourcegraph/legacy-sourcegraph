Cody is an AI coding assistant tool that utilizes Sourcegraph's <a href="https://docs.sourcegraph.com/cody/explanations/code_graph_context"> code graph</a> and Large Language Models (LLMs) to write code and provide answers based on your codebase and code graph.

Think of Cody as your personal coding assistant with a comprehensive understanding of your open source code, StackOverflow questions, and entire codebase.

Cody helps you answer questions, write code, and offer suggestions for code improvement.

## Features

<!-- NOTE: These should stay roughly in sync with client/cody/README.md, although these need to be not specific to VS Code. -->

- **ü§ñ Chatbot that knows _your_ code:** Writes code and answers questions with knowledge of your entire codebase, following your project's code conventions and architecture better than other AI code chatbots.
- **‚ú® Fix code inline:** Interactively writes and refactors code for you, based on quick natural-language instructions.
- **üìñ Recipes:** Generates unit tests, documentation, and more, with full codebase awareness.
- **Autocomplete:** Get suggestions from Cody as you're coding.

### ü§ñ Chatbot that knows _your_ code

[**üìΩÔ∏è Demo**](https://twitter.com/beyang/status/1647744307045228544)

You can chat with Cody in the editor or in the Sourcegraph sidebar.

Examples of the kinds of questions Cody can handle:

- How is our app's secret storage implemented on Linux?
- Where is the CI config for the web integration tests?
- Write a new GraphQL resolver for the AuditLog.
- Why is the UserConnectionResolver giving an error `unknown user`, and how do I fix it?

Cody tells you which code files it read to generate its response. (If Cody gives a wrong answer, please share feedback so we can improve it.)

### ‚ú® Fix code inline

[**üìΩÔ∏è Demo**](https://twitter.com/sqs/status/1647673013343780864)

In your editor, just sprinkle your code with instructions in natural language, select the code, and run `Cody: Fixup` (<kbd>Ctrl+Alt+/</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl+Opt+/</kbd>). Cody will figure out what edits to make.

Examples of the kinds of fixup instructions Cody can handle:

- "Factor out any common helper functions" (when multiple functions are selected)
- "Use the imported CSS module's class names"
- "Extract the list item to a separate React component"
- "Handle errors better"
- "Add helpful debug log statements"
- "Make this work" (seriously, it often works--try it!)

### üìñ Recipes

In your editor, select the recipes tab or  right-click on a selection of code and choose one of the `Ask Cody > ...` recipes, such as:

- Explain code
- Generate unit test
- Generate docstring
- Improve variable names
- Translate to different language
- Summarize recent code changes
- Detect code smells
- Generate release notes

### Autocomplete

Cody provides real-time code autocompletion as you're typing. As you start coding, or after you type a comment, Cody will look at the context around your open files and file history to predict what you're trying to implement and provide autocomplete.
