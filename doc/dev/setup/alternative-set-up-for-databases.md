# Alternative set up for databases

Sourcegraph requires databases to be accessible to run locally. We recommend and support a default approach that is suited for everyone, regardless of their familiarity with the topic. 

But it's still possible to use alternative ways to install databases if you want to and know what you're doing: `sg checks` will still perform correctly, but you're on your own for the installation process: see the [alternative instructions section](#alternative-instructions).
