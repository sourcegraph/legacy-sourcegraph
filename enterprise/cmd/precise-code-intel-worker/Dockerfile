# We need root to add the correct version of curl, but we don't want to
# accidentally change the default USER of the docker container while we're doing so.
# So, we:
#  1) check to make sure the current user is what we expect
#  2) switch to root and install the patched version of curl
#  3) switch back to the old user, double checking to make sure that we actually are running as the old user
