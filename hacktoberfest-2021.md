# Welcome Hacktoberfest participants

Thank you for checking out the [Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com) repo, and for considering contributing to this project!

If you need guidance on contributing to open source, please review the tutorial [How To Create a Pull Request on GitHub](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github) or watch the video [Your First Pull Request with Lyn Muldrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZtECuvNRiw). 

For additional guidance, review the [official Hacktoberfest site](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/). 

_Hacktoberfest contributions are limited to what is described below. All other pull requests will be marked as **invalid**._

## Step 1 — Choose an issue

Select one of the issues labeled as [good first issue](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/projects/210). 

Each of these issues is either code issue in the Sourcegraph OSS project or a troubeshooting technical tutorial for educational purposes. **If you want to solve a technical tutorial issue, please follow [this guide instead](https://github.com/sourcegraph/learn/blob/main/docs/hacktoberfest-2021.md)**.

Take a look at [Sourcegraph's architecture](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev/background-information/architecture#diagram) to familiarize yourself with the area you will be working on. Each component is clickable in the diagram and will lead to the associated code base.

## Step 2 - Set up your local development environment.

Follow our [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/blob/main/doc/dev/index.md#getting-started) to set up your local development environment so you can contribute to Sourcegraph's code base.

Check our [troubleshooting section](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/blob/main/doc/dev/index.md#troubleshooting) if you run into problems. If they persist, [reach out to us](https://about.sourcegraph.com/community/) and we'll help you out.

(optional) We also highly recommend adding the [Sourcegraph browser extension](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/integration/browser_extension) to your browser. The open-source Sourcegraph browser extension adds code intelligence to files and diffs on GitHub and other code hosts and it creates a search shortcut in your URL location bar. The extension will make it easier for you to read and understand any code base you contribute to.

## Step 3 — Clone the project

Once you have selected an issue and set up your dev environment, clone the project locally and create a branch for your work.

## Step 4 — Solve the issue

Write the code that will solve the issue and don't forget to add [tests](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/blob/main/doc/dev/how-to/testing.md). 

## Step 5 — Open a pull request

When you are satisfied, open your pull request referencing the issue that you are resolving. **Add a `sg hacktoberfest 2021` label to your pull request** to increase its discoverability. Please note that maintainers will make the ultimate decision of whether or not pull requests are merged into the project.
